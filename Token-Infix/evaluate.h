// Simple Expression Evaluation 
// This program will evaluate simple arithmetic expressions
// represented as a linked-list of tokens.  Keyboard input
// will be accepted into a string, which will be converted
// into that linked list.
//
// If the first symbol in the input string is an operator,
// then the value of the previous expression will be taken
// as an implicit first operand.
//
// The expressions may consist of the following:
// -- integer values (which may have multiple digits)
// -- simple arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, /, % )
// -- matched parentheses for grouping

// This implementation consists of a set of mutually-recursive 
// functions. which will track the structure of the expression.
//
// A sum expression is the sum or difference of one or more products.
// A product expression is the product or quotient of one or more factors.
// A factor may be a number or a parenthesized sum expression.
